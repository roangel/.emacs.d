*** Safe controller looks a bit weird behaviour?
*** TODO Maybe check if safe controller can be improved?
**** Right now some oscillations in some CFs, due to model mismatch
** TODO Need to find out if we want the boundary box to be updated in student's computer when they change in teacher's computer
*** Update the information from DB each time we run an script? Or each time we change that information?
** TODO Start with the student GUI. Need to include:
*** When GUI starts, launches Student.launch script.
*** Need to make sure that this node does not need to be killed at all in any moment, we can recover without restarting the GUI
**** Student.launch creates the student node with student ID, and prepares everything so that we can start controlling the drone.
**** After that, need to display:
***** RF status: connected or disconnected?
****** Button to connect via RF and to retry in case we couldn't. Once we connect, everything else becomes available
***** CF enabled or disabled?
****** Button to enable/disable
***** Battery level
***** Current position (from vicon)
***** Current controller (custom or safe)
****** Button to go to safe controller
***** Current SetPoint (only for safe controller?)
****** Way of setting the setpoint
